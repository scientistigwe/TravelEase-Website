<h2 id="management-and-development">Project Management and Development Approach</h2>

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: The Team held **16** Hurdles through Slack Platform, ensuring alignment with user needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.

<p align="center"><strong>A screenshot of a one of the team's huddles through slack.</strong></p>
<img src="./assets/images/team-huddle.png" alt="Screenshot of the team's huddle" width="600" height="100%">
<br>
<br>

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, the team managed
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/scientistigwe/TravelEase-Website?)](https://github.com/scientistigwe/TravelEase-Website/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/scientistigwe/TravelEase-Website?)](https://github.com/scientistigwe/TravelEase-Website/issues) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively.

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: We achieved **26 story points** across **1 sprint**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.

<h2 id="design-and-styling">Design and Styling</h2>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

Given the serene ambiance of the establishment, the website echoes this sentiment through its design. Employing a predominantly skyblue background conveys cleanliness, brightness, and sterilityâattributes associated with a such setting.

<h3 id="color">Color</h3>

- **Background - Skyblue Image (#87CEEB)**: This color was selected because it conveys a sense of tranquility and openness, aligning with the theme of travel and exploration. The light blue hue evokes feelings of calmness and serenity, which are often associated with leisure and vacation.

- **Navigation menu items - Light Gray (#f5f5f5)**: Light gray provides a neutral and calming backdrop for the content, ensuring readability and visual comfort for users.

- **h1 - h6, p - Black (#000000)** - Black text on an off-white text background offers high contrast against the skyblue background, ensuring readability and accessibility for users
- **footer - [default]** - we have kept most of our text the same default black colour because it matches well with the rest of the site, providing a solid contrast with the background, and causing no issues.

<h3 id="font">Font</h3>

- main font: Montserrat - We have chosen Montserrat because it is a font-style that is widely available within most, if not all, browsers and the font maintains a professional style.
- Secondary font - sans-serif

<h3 id="media">Media</h3>

**Background image** - a mix of an iceberg / sky background that features lighter colours. Lighter colours are generally viewed as more positive, and we want our customers to associate our site with positivity, whether that be through colours or otherwise.

**Contact section** - Our contact button is simply located in the top left of our page to ensure that it is abundantly clear to our customers that we are easy to contact. The page itself is currently work in progress.

**Plans and Pricing** - This is one of the menu items located second from right. It has a link pointing to plans and ricing page.
