<h2 id="design-and-styling">Design and Styling</h2>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

Given the serene ambiance of the establishment, the website echoes this sentiment through its design. Employing a predominantly white background conveys cleanliness, brightness, and sterilityâattributes associated with a tranquil setting. Complementary background hues evoke a sense of calmness, while vibrant and colorful imagery aims to immerse visitors in the **[name of project]** ambiance.

<h3 id="color">Color</h3>

- **Navigation menu items - Dark Navy Blue (#001F3F)**: This color provides a strong contrast with the sky blue background image and enhances readability.
- **Main background color - **#color hex** (color name)** - I chose this color because **\*\***\***\*\***
- **h1 headings and nav bar - [default]** - reason
- **h2 headings - [default]** - reason
- **p - [default]** - reason
- **footer - [default]** - we have kept most of our text the same default black colour because it matches well with the rest of the site, providing a solid contrast with the background, and causing no issues.

<h3 id="font">Font</h3>

- main font: Montserrat - We have chosen Montserrat because it is a font-style that is widely available within most, if not all, browsers and the font maintains a professional style.
- Secondary font - sans-serif

<h3 id="media">Media</h3>

**Hero image** - a mix of an iceberg / sky background that features lighter colours. Lighter colours are generally viewed as more positive, and we want our customers to associate our site with positivity, whether that be through colours or otherwise.

**Contact section** - Our contact button is simply located in the top left of our page to ensure that it is abundantly clear to our customers that we are easy to contact. The page itself is currently work in progress.

**Plans and Pricing** - short description and reason for selection

**Our Team** - short description and reason for selection

**Gallery** - We have integrated the features of a gallery into our pages, by adding various sliders of a large variety of pictures. The pictures featured are chosen carefully to match background-colours of surrounding elements and the attached description.

**Contact Us** - short description and reason for selection
